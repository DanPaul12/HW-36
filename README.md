created a resume with all the sections specified, used flex box to style the different sections (the two main sections are
flexboxes within a flexbox) afer experimenting wih grid and not liking it much. I mostly used the time to play with different fonts and colors,
I already practiced the transition effects a lot in the previous assignment so didn't wanna spend too much time on that
